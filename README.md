# ðŸ§  Simon Memory Game

This project helped me apply and deepen my understanding of:

*  HTML for structuring the game interface

*  CSS for styling and layout design

*  JavaScript for game logic, interactivity, and state management

ðŸ§  Key Features

  *  Sequence-based gameplay with progressive difficulty

  *  Sound effects integrated for each button press and game events

  *  Dynamic memory of the pattern using JavaScript arrays

  *  Responsive and visually engaging user interface

  *  Real-time feedback for correct and incorrect inputs

ðŸ§© Key Learnings

* Practiced DOM manipulation and event handling

* Applied data structures like arrays to store and compare sequences

* Understood how to manage game state transitions (start, level up, game over)

* Integrated audio feedback using JavaScriptâ€™s Audio object

ðŸš€ How to Play

* The game starts by flashing a color button and playing a sound.

* You must click the buttons in the same sequence as shown.

* Each level adds one new color to the sequence.

* A wrong input ends the game and resets the sequence.
